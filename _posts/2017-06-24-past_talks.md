<h2>On indoor localization: a TinyML-based classification approach | Diego Méndez Chaves</h2>
<p>Aug 03, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

<p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
    Positioning systems have gained paramount importance for many different productive sector; however, traditional systems such as Global Positioning System (GPS) have failed to offer accurate and scalable solutions for indoor positioning requirements. Nowadays, alternative solutions such as fingerprinting allow the recognition of the characteristic signature of a location based on RF signal acquisition. In our work, a machine learning (ML) approach is selected in order to classify the RSSI information acquired by multiple scanning stations from TAG broadcasting messages. TinyML has been considered for this project, as it is a rapidly growing technological paradigm that aims to assist the design and implementation of ML mechanisms in resource-constrained embedded devices. This talk presents the design, implementation, and deployment of embedded devices capable of communicating and sending information to a central system that determines the location of objects in a defined environment. A neural network (deep learning) is trained and deployed on the edge, allowing the multiple external error factors that affect the accuracy of traditional position estimation algorithms to be considered. Edge Impulse is used as the main platform for data standardization, pre-processing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

<h2>Sunlight for wireless communication | Marco Zúñiga</h2>
<p>Apr 06, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

<p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
    We, humans, already use 50% more energy moving information than moving airplanes around the world. Communication is central to our societies but is taking a toll on the earth.

    We want to use a free, abundant, and natural resource for wireless communication: sunlight. Similar to the way you can use a mirror to communicate by reflecting light, our aim is to change the surfaces of objects to control their reflection properties to send information, but without noticing any flicker!
    
    In this manner, objects will be able to talk to each other using daylight, an eco-friendly solution. In this talk, we will present some of our recent work on this exciting area and its potential applications.
    
    A world that communicates through natural light. That’s the goal.

<h2>The IoT and the two sides of Sustainability | Carlo Boano</h2>
<p>Mar 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

<p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
IoT systems are often portrayed as a key driver for sustainability and as an essential technology to achieve many of the seventeen United Nations’ sustainable development goals by 2030. Among others, IoT systems can help improving health and well-being, building smart cities, promoting a responsible production and consumption, increasing awareness and visibility into energy and resource usage, as well as facilitating access to clean energy. At the same time, sustainability is often not a concern during the design of an IoT system: several IoT gadgets are unnecessary, many IoT products become quickly obsolete, and poorly-performing IoT devices are quickly dismissed. As a result, IoT hardware often ends up as e-waste into landfill after a very short lifespan, which is worrying considering the magnitude of IoT devices expected in the next decade. In this talk, I will illustrate this paradox with concrete examples and highlight the need to maximize the usability and lifetime of IoT systems, presenting technical solutions that could help in this regard.</p>

--
Dec 01, 2022 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
This seminar will engage in the lessons learned from designing, developing and deploying the LoRa-DTN IoT platform. This platform was tailor-made by and for the Sami reindeer herding population in the north of Sweden. Due to the harsh Arctic winter conditions, lack of power and internet infrastructure, remoteness and inaccessible terrains, conventional off-the-shelf IoT solutions were not applicable. Hence, the LoRa-DTN platform was developed in order to provide reindeer herders ability to track their reindeer herds, exchange short messages, use drones as a data relay and monitor the ice thickness on lakes during winter time. The platform is built on a custom hardware and employs LoRa radios and custom-built network protocol based on the Delay Tolerant Network architecture (using Store-And-Forward principle).

**About Speaker:**
Since 2016, Samo Grasic has worked at Dálvvadis economical association, Jokkmokk, where he designs and develops the Nomatrack LoRa-DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) platform. This platform is tailor-made for reindeer herding purposes in remote Arctic environments. Samo is the member of the The Inter Planetary Networking Special Interest Group and the co-author of the PRoPHET routing protocol (RFC 6693). Samo received his PhD from Luleå University of Technology, in the subject of of Human Work Science, in 2014. Here, focus ison development and deployment of the ICT infrastructure DTN for sparsely populated Arctic regions. Samo’s interests include routing in computer networks, energy harvesting, low power systems, soft, and hardware development as well as embedded systems. Samo is also interested in the social, and economical aspects of ICT deployments. Prior to his academic career, Samo worked for more than six years in the industry, developing hardware and software components for meteorological and radiological systems.

Toit, a modern framework for IoT | Florian Loitsch
--
Nov 03, 2022 

**About Topic:**
Modern microcontrollers, like the ESP32, are more powerful than the first Unix machines. Despite their
speed, they are still treated like 8-bit microcontrollers from the 90s: by flashing monolithic applications on them.
Individual components have no protections from each other, and the development process is brittle, since
a change or bug in one part of the firmware could adversely affect the rest.
This doesn't need to be. In this presentation we will present Toit. A modern framework for IoT devices. A new language, virtual machine, and lots of libraries, work together to provide a great development experience with properties we generally expect from operating systems: memory separation, individual applications, ease of use with a high-level garbage-collected language, and fast development iterations.


**About Speaker:**
Florian Loitsch did his PhD in compiler technologies, compiling Scheme to JavaScript. He was then hired by Google to work on V8 (Chrome's JavaScript engine). He was part of the team that developed the Dart programming language, for which he was the technical lead for the Dart-to-Javascript compiler and later for the Dart libraries. Almost 5 years ago, he co-founded Toitware, where he has been developing and improving Toit since.
