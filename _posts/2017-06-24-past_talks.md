<h2>The IoT and the two sides of Sustainability | Carlo Boano</h2>
<p>Mar 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

<p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
IoT systems are often portrayed as a key driver for sustainability and as an essential technology to achieve many of the seventeen United Nations’ sustainable development goals by 2030. Among others, IoT systems can help improving health and well-being, building smart cities, promoting a responsible production and consumption, increasing awareness and visibility into energy and resource usage, as well as facilitating access to clean energy. At the same time, sustainability is often not a concern during the design of an IoT system: several IoT gadgets are unnecessary, many IoT products become quickly obsolete, and poorly-performing IoT devices are quickly dismissed. As a result, IoT hardware often ends up as e-waste into landfill after a very short lifespan, which is worrying considering the magnitude of IoT devices expected in the next decade. In this talk, I will illustrate this paradox with concrete examples and highlight the need to maximize the usability and lifetime of IoT systems, presenting technical solutions that could help in this regard.</p>

<h2>AIoT for environmental Intelligence | Pietro Manzoni</h2>
<p>Feb 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>
<p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
Environmental Intelligence refers to using digital technologies to gain insight into our impact on the environment and develop strategies to mitigate or reverse the effects of climate change. The talk will provide insights related to the applications of AIoT for environmental intelligence, focusing on data collection. It will show the approach and some of the results from research activities related to monitoring a natural lagoon in the southern part of Spain, namely the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, Spain). This ecosystem supports many human activities encompassing tourism, agriculture, fishing, and mining, leading to its deterioration. The project’s overall objective was to develop cross-cutting and green technology for modeling and predicting socio-environmental processes across different temporal and spatial scales. We wanted to achieve this through a digital twin strategy that allows researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers to collect data cost-effectively and create more precise models and predictions to support better decision-making.</p>

Low Power Wide-Area Wireless Internet of Things with LoRaWAN | Dirk Pesch 
--
Jan 05, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
Connectivity, particularly wireless connectivity, is a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things. A plethora of technologies exist, ranging from short-range to long-range and low to medium power options. Recently, long-range, low-power wireless communication technologies have been introduced for both licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum technologies such as LoRa/LoRaWAN have become very popular because of their low cost, open standard and open-source software support. However, the current standard has many weaknesses in supporting a vision of dense, wireless IoT device deployment. In this talk, we will briefly review long-range, low-power wireless technologies, review some of the weaknesses of LoRaWAN and present a range of advances that address these weaknesses; in particular, we will focus on medium access fairness, power efficiency and delay performance for both terrestrial and satellite-based smart city and industrial IoT applications.

**About Speaker:**
Dirk Pesch is a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Information Technology at University College Cork, where he leads research initiatives in the area of future networks, the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems with applications in smart and connected communities and smart manufacturing. Dirk’s research interests focus on the study, design and performance evaluation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and associated communication protocols and system architectures and their applications to smart, energy-efficient and sustainable cities and connected communities as well as smart manufacturing. He is also interested in addressing the interoperability problem of IoT/CPS, which limits the widespread adoption of the technology to many real-world problems and situations. Dirk is the Director of a national doctoral training initiative, the Science Foundation Ireland funded Centre for Research Training in Advanced Networks for Sustainable Societies. He is also a Principal Investigator of the SFI-funded CONNECT Centre for Future Networks and the CONFIRM Centre for Smart Manufacturing.

LoRa-DTN: Tailor-made IoT platform for extreme Arctic conditions | Samo Grasic
--
Dec 01, 2022 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
This seminar will engage in the lessons learned from designing, developing and deploying the LoRa-DTN IoT platform. This platform was tailor-made by and for the Sami reindeer herding population in the north of Sweden. Due to the harsh Arctic winter conditions, lack of power and internet infrastructure, remoteness and inaccessible terrains, conventional off-the-shelf IoT solutions were not applicable. Hence, the LoRa-DTN platform was developed in order to provide reindeer herders ability to track their reindeer herds, exchange short messages, use drones as a data relay and monitor the ice thickness on lakes during winter time. The platform is built on a custom hardware and employs LoRa radios and custom-built network protocol based on the Delay Tolerant Network architecture (using Store-And-Forward principle).

**About Speaker:**
Since 2016, Samo Grasic has worked at Dálvvadis economical association, Jokkmokk, where he designs and develops the Nomatrack LoRa-DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) platform. This platform is tailor-made for reindeer herding purposes in remote Arctic environments. Samo is the member of the The Inter Planetary Networking Special Interest Group and the co-author of the PRoPHET routing protocol (RFC 6693). Samo received his PhD from Luleå University of Technology, in the subject of of Human Work Science, in 2014. Here, focus ison development and deployment of the ICT infrastructure DTN for sparsely populated Arctic regions. Samo’s interests include routing in computer networks, energy harvesting, low power systems, soft, and hardware development as well as embedded systems. Samo is also interested in the social, and economical aspects of ICT deployments. Prior to his academic career, Samo worked for more than six years in the industry, developing hardware and software components for meteorological and radiological systems.

Toit, a modern framework for IoT | Florian Loitsch
--
Nov 03, 2022 

**About Topic:**
Modern microcontrollers, like the ESP32, are more powerful than the first Unix machines. Despite their
speed, they are still treated like 8-bit microcontrollers from the 90s: by flashing monolithic applications on them.
Individual components have no protections from each other, and the development process is brittle, since
a change or bug in one part of the firmware could adversely affect the rest.
This doesn't need to be. In this presentation we will present Toit. A modern framework for IoT devices. A new language, virtual machine, and lots of libraries, work together to provide a great development experience with properties we generally expect from operating systems: memory separation, individual applications, ease of use with a high-level garbage-collected language, and fast development iterations.


**About Speaker:**
Florian Loitsch did his PhD in compiler technologies, compiling Scheme to JavaScript. He was then hired by Google to work on V8 (Chrome's JavaScript engine). He was part of the team that developed the Dart programming language, for which he was the technical lead for the Dart-to-Javascript compiler and later for the Dart libraries. Almost 5 years ago, he co-founded Toitware, where he has been developing and improving Toit since.
