Florian Loitsch - Toit, a modern framework for IoT
--
Nov 03, 2022 

**About Topic:**
Modern microcontrollers, like the ESP32, are more powerful than the first Unix machines. Despite their
speed, they are still treated like 8-bit microcontrollers from the 90s: by flashing monolithic applications on them.
Individual components have no protections from each other, and the development process is brittle, since
a change or bug in one part of the firmware could adversely affect the rest.
This doesn't need to be. In this presentation we will present Toit. A modern framework for IoT devices. A new language, virtual machine, and lots of libraries, work together to provide a great development experience with properties we generally expect from operating systems: memory separation, individual applications, ease of use with a high-level garbage-collected language, and fast development iterations.


**About Speaker:**
Florian Loitsch did his PhD in compiler technologies, compiling Scheme to JavaScript. He was then hired by Google to work on V8 (Chrome's JavaScript engine). He was part of the team that developed the Dart programming language, for which he was the technical lead for the Dart-to-Javascript compiler and later for the Dart libraries. Almost 5 years ago, he co-founded Toitware, where he has been developing and improving Toit since.
