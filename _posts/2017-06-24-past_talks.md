Low Power Wide-Area Wireless Internet of Things with LoRaWAN | Dirk Pesch 
--
Jan 05, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
Connectivity, particularly wireless connectivity, is a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things. A plethora of technologies exist, ranging from short-range to long-range and low to medium power options. Recently, long-range, low-power wireless communication technologies have been introduced for both licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum technologies such as LoRa/LoRaWAN have become very popular because of their low cost, open standard and open-source software support. However, the current standard has many weaknesses in supporting a vision of dense, wireless IoT device deployment. In this talk, we will briefly review long-range, low-power wireless technologies, review some of the weaknesses of LoRaWAN and present a range of advances that address these weaknesses; in particular, we will focus on medium access fairness, power efficiency and delay performance for both terrestrial and satellite-based smart city and industrial IoT applications.

**About Speaker:**
Dirk Pesch is a Professor in the School of Computer Science and Information Technology at University College Cork, where he leads research initiatives in the area of future networks, the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems with applications in smart and connected communities and smart manufacturing. Dirk’s research interests focus on the study, design and performance evaluation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and associated communication protocols and system architectures and their applications to smart, energy-efficient and sustainable cities and connected communities as well as smart manufacturing. He is also interested in addressing the interoperability problem of IoT/CPS, which limits the widespread adoption of the technology to many real-world problems and situations. Dirk is the Director of a national doctoral training initiative, the Science Foundation Ireland funded Centre for Research Training in Advanced Networks for Sustainable Societies. He is also a Principal Investigator of the SFI-funded CONNECT Centre for Future Networks and the CONFIRM Centre for Smart Manufacturing. He is an editorial board member of a number of journals and contributes to ACM/IEEE/IFIP conference organization in his area of expertise. Prior to joining academia, Dirk was a design engineer with Nokia in Germany and the UK, developing and implementing communication protocols for a range of cordless telecommunication products. Dirk received a Dipl.Ing. degree from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and a PhD from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland.

LoRa-DTN: Tailor-made IoT platform for extreme Arctic conditions | Samo Grasic
--
Dec 01, 2022 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
This seminar will engage in the lessons learned from designing, developing and deploying the LoRa-DTN IoT platform. This platform was tailor-made by and for the Sami reindeer herding population in the north of Sweden. Due to the harsh Arctic winter conditions, lack of power and internet infrastructure, remoteness and inaccessible terrains, conventional off-the-shelf IoT solutions were not applicable. Hence, the LoRa-DTN platform was developed in order to provide reindeer herders ability to track their reindeer herds, exchange short messages, use drones as a data relay and monitor the ice thickness on lakes during winter time. The platform is built on a custom hardware and employs LoRa radios and custom-built network protocol based on the Delay Tolerant Network architecture (using Store-And-Forward principle).

**About Speaker:**
Since 2016, Samo Grasic has worked at Dálvvadis economical association, Jokkmokk, where he designs and develops the Nomatrack LoRa-DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) platform. This platform is tailor-made for reindeer herding purposes in remote Arctic environments. Samo is the member of the The Inter Planetary Networking Special Interest Group and the co-author of the PRoPHET routing protocol (RFC 6693). Samo received his PhD from Luleå University of Technology, in the subject of of Human Work Science, in 2014. Here, focus ison development and deployment of the ICT infrastructure DTN for sparsely populated Arctic regions. Samo’s interests include routing in computer networks, energy harvesting, low power systems, soft, and hardware development as well as embedded systems. Samo is also interested in the social, and economical aspects of ICT deployments. Prior to his academic career, Samo worked for more than six years in the industry, developing hardware and software components for meteorological and radiological systems.

Toit, a modern framework for IoT | Florian Loitsch
--
Nov 03, 2022 

**About Topic:**
Modern microcontrollers, like the ESP32, are more powerful than the first Unix machines. Despite their
speed, they are still treated like 8-bit microcontrollers from the 90s: by flashing monolithic applications on them.
Individual components have no protections from each other, and the development process is brittle, since
a change or bug in one part of the firmware could adversely affect the rest.
This doesn't need to be. In this presentation we will present Toit. A modern framework for IoT devices. A new language, virtual machine, and lots of libraries, work together to provide a great development experience with properties we generally expect from operating systems: memory separation, individual applications, ease of use with a high-level garbage-collected language, and fast development iterations.


**About Speaker:**
Florian Loitsch did his PhD in compiler technologies, compiling Scheme to JavaScript. He was then hired by Google to work on V8 (Chrome's JavaScript engine). He was part of the team that developed the Dart programming language, for which he was the technical lead for the Dart-to-Javascript compiler and later for the Dart libraries. Almost 5 years ago, he co-founded Toitware, where he has been developing and improving Toit since.
