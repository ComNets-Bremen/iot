Pietro Manzoni - AIoT for environmental Intelligence
--
Feb 02, 2023

**About topic:**
Environmental Intelligence refers to using digital technologies to gain insight into our impact on the environment and develop strategies to mitigate or reverse the effects of climate change. The talk will provide insights related to the applications of AIoT for environmental intelligence, focusing on data collection. It will show the approach and some of the results from research activities related to monitoring a natural lagoon in the southern part of Spain, namely the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, Spain). This ecosystem supports many human activities encompassing tourism, agriculture, fishing, and mining, leading to its deterioration. The project's overall objective was to develop cross-cutting and green technology for modeling and predicting socio-environmental processes across different temporal and spatial scales. We wanted to achieve this through a digital twin strategy that allows researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers to collect data cost-effectively and create more precise models and predictions to support better decision-making.

**About Speaker:**
He received the master degree in Computer Science from the "Università degli Studi" of Milan, Italy, in 1989, and the PhD degree in Computer Science from the "Politecnico di Milano", Italy, in 1995. From November 1992 to February 1993 he did an internship at the Bellcore Labs, Red Bank, New Jersey, USA, and from February 1994 to November 1994 he was a visiting researcher at the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) Berkeley, California, USA. He is full professor of computer engineering at the "Universitat Politècnica de València", Spain. He is the coordinator of the Computer Networks Research Group (GRC) and a senior member of the IEEE. His research activity is related to the use of Mobile Wireless Networks to the design of dynamic systems. He is currently working on solutions for the Internet of Things focusing on LPWAN-based networks, and Pub/Sub systems. He published more than 200 scientific papers in conferences and more than 90 papers in international journals.; his Google scholar H index is 49. He is part or has been part of various editorial boards and organizing committees of International journals and conferences.
