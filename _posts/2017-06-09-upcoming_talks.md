Pietro Manzoni - AIoT for environmental Intelligence
--
Feb 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
Environmental Intelligence refers to using digital technologies to gain insight into our impact on the environment and develop strategies to mitigate or reverse the effects of climate change. The talk will provide insights related to the applications of AIoT for environmental intelligence, focusing on data collection. It will show the approach and some of the results from research activities related to monitoring a natural lagoon in the southern part of Spain, namely the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, Spain). This ecosystem supports many human activities encompassing tourism, agriculture, fishing, and mining, leading to its deterioration. The project's overall objective was to develop cross-cutting and green technology for modeling and predicting socio-environmental processes across different temporal and spatial scales. We wanted to achieve this through a digital twin strategy that allows researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers to collect data cost-effectively and create more precise models and predictions to support better decision-making.

**About Speaker:**
He received the master degree in Computer Science from the "Università degli Studi" of Milan, Italy, in 1989, and the PhD degree in Computer Science from the "Politecnico di Milano", Italy, in 1995. From November 1992 to February 1993 he did an internship at the Bellcore Labs, Red Bank, New Jersey, USA, and from February 1994 to November 1994 he was a visiting researcher at the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) Berkeley, California, USA. He is full professor of computer engineering at the "Universitat Politècnica de València", Spain. He is the coordinator of the Computer Networks Research Group (GRC) and a senior member of the IEEE. His research activity is related to the use of Mobile Wireless Networks to the design of dynamic systems. He is currently working on solutions for the Internet of Things focusing on LPWAN-based networks, and Pub/Sub systems. He published more than 200 scientific papers in conferences and more than 90 papers in international journals.; his Google scholar H index is 49. He is part or has been part of various editorial boards and organizing committees of International journals and conferences.

Carlo Boano - The IoT and the two sides of Sustainability
--
Mar 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET

**About Topic:**
IoT systems are often portrayed as a key driver for sustainability and as an essential technology to achieve many of the seventeen United Nations' sustainable development goals by 2030. Among others, IoT systems can help improving health and well-being, building smart cities, promoting a responsible production and consumption, increasing awareness and visibility into energy and resource usage, as well as facilitating access to clean energy. At the same time, sustainability is often not a concern during the design of an IoT system: several IoT gadgets are unnecessary, many IoT products become quickly obsolete, and poorly-performing IoT devices are quickly dismissed. As a result, IoT hardware often ends up as e-waste into landfill after a very short lifespan, which is worrying considering the magnitude of IoT devices expected in the next decade. In this talk, I will illustrate this paradox with concrete examples and highlight the need to maximize the usability and lifetime of IoT systems, presenting technical solutions that could help in this regard. 

**About Speaker:**
Carlo Alberto Boano is an associate professor at the Institute of Technical Informatics of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), Austria. He received the Venia Docendi in "Embedded Systems" from TU Graz with an Habilitation thesis entitled "Technologies and Tools for the Design of Dependable Networked Embedded Systems" in 2020. He also received from TU Graz a doctoral degree under the auspices of the President of the Austrian Republic in 2016 with a thesis entitled "Dependable Wireless Sensor Networks" and completed under the supervision of Kay Römer.
Before joining TU Graz, Carlo Alberto Boano was researcher at the University of Lübeck, Germany (2009-2013) and at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden (2008-2009). During his post-doctoral time at TU Graz, he has visited Thiemo Voigt's group at Uppsala University, Mun Choon Chan's group at the National University of Singapore, and Yuan He's group at Tsinghua University.
Carlo Alberto's research interests encompass the design of dependable networked embedded systems, with emphasis on the efficiency and reliability of low-power wireless communications, as well as on the robustness of IoT networking protocols against environmental influences. Within this area, he has published over 100 peer-reviewed contributions -- including papers at prestigious venues ranked CORE A/A*, such as SenSys, IPSN, NDSS, INFOCOM, RTSS, ICNP, ICDCS -- and received several awards.
