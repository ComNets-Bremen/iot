                        <h2>Trust Management in Social Internet of Things | Barbora Buhnova</h2>
                        <p>May 04, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            Digitalization is leading us towards a future where people, processes, data and things are not only interacting with each other, but might start forming societies on their own. In these dynamic systems, converging towards Social Internet of Things (SIoT), trust management on the level of human-to-thing as well as thing-to-thing interaction becomes an essential ingredient to supervise safe and secure progress of our digitalized future. In this talk, we will look into the essential elements of trust management in complex digital ecosystems and SIoT, including trust assessment and its influencing factors (e.g., feeling vulnerable), trust propagation (e.g., via reputation), and trust updates (e.g., via dynamic certification schemes). We will give an overview of the current open discussions about the trust management strategies and discuss their risks and related trust attacks (e.g, self-promotion or whitewashing).
