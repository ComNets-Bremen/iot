                        <h2>Connecting Plants and Soil through Low-data-rate Underground Sensing and High-data-rate In-Field Autonomy to Grow More Crop for Drop | Mehmet Can Vuran</h2>
                        <p>Oct 05, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            The increasing global food demand necessitates advancements in precision agriculture, underscoring the importance of understanding the relationship between soil and plants. This talk focuses on the interconnectedness of the agricultural environment and its operational elements through the Agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT) as a powerful solution to address food production challenges. The innovations in low-power wireless communications and sensing have made deploying sensors below the soil surface feasible. These sensors directly link the soil conditions and plant responses, enabling real-time monitoring of their interaction. We will discuss the technical aspects of wireless communication within these underground settings, outlining both the potential and challenges of data transmission in underground environments. Moreover, our research findings from extensive field experiments will be presented, highlighting the influence of specific crops, such as corn and soybeans, on the millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel. Understanding these interactions is pivotal in realizing high-speed agricultural networks that could reshape how we approach autonomous farming operations. The interconnectedness of soil and plants highlights the role of heterogeneous Ag-IoT systems in enhancing our understanding and management of this vital relationship in the face of growing food production challenges. The talk will conclude by discussing future challenges for Ag-IoT and emphasizing its transformative potential to revolutionize the agricultural sector, optimize resource allocation, and effectively address future food production challenges.

                        <h2>IoT in digital agriculture | Nathalie Mitton</h2>
                        <p>Dec 07, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            Digital technologies are spreading in agriculture as they do in other economic sectors. One of the emerging technologies in agriculture is IoT and among it wireless sensors and drones. Sensors are for instance deployed to monitor the usage of intrants in different fields based on the needs of the crop. But this goes with different challenges. During this talk, we will see what are these challenges and how they could be tackled.
