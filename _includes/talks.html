                    <h2>New developments in Satellite LoRa for Science, IoT Applications and
                        Telemetry | Sebastian Büttrich </h2>
                    <p>Mar 07, 2024 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                    <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                        Converging progress in small satellite technology (Nanosats/Cubesats)
                        and IoT communications protocol LoRa have led to a number of new possibilities in leveraging this combination for scientific and IoT applications, as well as telemetry and operations control. Mostly in - but not limited to - Low Eart Orbit (LEO), LoRa enables small data connectivity at low price and extremely low power even in the most remote locations. Use cases range from agriculture to logistics, commercial to scientific, and from desert to sea to arctic. The talk will give an overview of the current state of the art and
                        expected developments.                    
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>About Speaker:</strong> 
                        Sebastian is a Research Lab Manager at the IT University of Copenhagen, and works with IoT, embedded/pervasive systems, wireles technology, open source / free software and sustainable energy, satellite connectivity, to build networks, systems, skills and capacity. He is also active as Trainer and Developer at Network Startup Research
                        Center (NSRC), helping develop networks for research and education, especially in Asia and Africa, with emphasis on global integration and sustainability. Institutional Member of the LoRa-Alliance, he is active in the Alliance's Regulatory and Satellite LoRa workgroups. Sebastian holds a Ph.D. in quantum physics from the Technical University of Berlin in Germany, with a focus on optics, radio spectroscopy, photovoltaic systems and scientific programming.

                    <h2>From Edge to Extreme Edge: Exploring the Dimensions of AI Inference in IoT | Roberto Morabito</h2>
                    <p>Apr 04, 2024 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                    <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                        This talk presents an in-depth exploration of the dual facets of AI inference within the IoT ecosystem: the established edge computing and the emerging "extreme edge", where TinyML is gaining prominence. We delve into how these two spheres interact and complement each other, driving advancements in AI-driven IoT applications. The discussion highlights how the proliferation of AI inference accelerators and varying software, hardware, and networking configurations are shaping the landscape of computational efficiency and real-time responsiveness. We will explore the development of frameworks that accommodate hardware diversity, ensuring optimized AI inference performance across a spectrum of devices. The seminar will also shed light on the strategies for seamless integration and coordination of devices at both the edge and the extreme edge. Emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making, we will discuss how these technologies enable robust AI capabilities in diverse applications. As a future perspective, we will briefly consider the potential role of emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, in further enhancing the capabilities and applications of AI inference within IoT.
