                        <h2>Sunlight for wireless communication | Marco Zúñiga</h2>
                        <p>Apr 06, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            We, humans, already use 50% more energy moving information than moving airplanes around the world. Communication is central to our societies but is taking a toll on the earth.

                            We want to use a free, abundant, and natural resource for wireless communication: sunlight. Similar to the way you can use a mirror to communicate by reflecting light, our aim is to change the surfaces of objects to control their reflection properties to send information, but without noticing any flicker!
                            
                            In this manner, objects will be able to talk to each other using daylight, an eco-friendly solution. In this talk, we will present some of our recent work on this exciting area and its potential applications.
                            
                            A world that communicates through natural light. That’s the goal.

                        <h2>Trust Management in Social Internet of Things | Barbora Buhnova</h2>
                        <p>May 04, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            Digitalization is leading us towards a future where people, processes, data and things are not only interacting with each other, but might start forming societies on their own. In these dynamic systems, converging towards Social Internet of Things (SIoT), trust management on the level of human-to-thing as well as thing-to-thing interaction becomes an essential ingredient to supervise safe and secure progress of our digitalized future. In this talk, we will look into the essential elements of trust management in complex digital ecosystems and SIoT, including trust assessment and its influencing factors (e.g., feeling vulnerable), trust propagation (e.g., via reputation), and trust updates (e.g., via dynamic certification schemes). We will give an overview of the current open discussions about the trust management strategies and discuss their risks and related trust attacks (e.g, self-promotion or whitewashing).
