                    <h2>Learning IoT - Roadmap and Challenges | Fredrik Ahlgren</h2>
                    <p>Feb 01, 2024 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                    <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                        Linnaeus University's four-year Applied IoT course serves as a case study for this seminar, focusing on adaptability in hardware selection, platform integration, and community engagement in an online learning environment. Transitioning from initial Pycom devices to Heltec and most recently to Raspberry Pi Pico, the course has navigated the evolving IoT landscape, posing challenges and insights for curriculum and lab design. While Canvas provides administrative structure, Discord acts as the linchpin for real-time student interaction. Despite its fully remote format, the course sustains hands-on lab sessions and incorporates industry talks for real-world context. The seminar aims to discuss the inherent challenges of maintaining high engagement and educational consistency in large-scale, decentralized, online settings
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>About Speaker:</strong> 
                        Fredrik Ahlgren is a Senior lecturer in Computer Science and Marine Engineering and he started his career in the Royal Swedish Navy in 2001, and have sailed as a Marine Engineering officer on fast attack crafts, corvettes and submarines. Fredrik has always had a very keen interest in computers and new technology, and after and during the PhD started the transition from mechanical/marine engineering to computer science, with the focus on applying machine learning to solve problems. In 2020 I was living in Vancouver and teaching marine engineering, IoT and data analysis for M.Sc students at University of British Columbia, NAME (Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering). Fredrik has previously been teaching in the Marine Engineering programme with focus on pumping technology course, hydromechanics and machinery systems. Previous research comprises of energy efficiency in shipping from the data perspective, using machine learning (ML) methods for energy predictions. The research is now focused on applied IoT. He is now the lead and project manager of the IoT-lab at Linnaeus University and has also been the course administrator for the summer course Applied Internet of Things both the summer of 2020, 2021 and 2022, comprising of hundreds of students from all over the world. Fredrik also teach M.Sc courses in Applied IoT, as well as introductory programming in Python, machine learning (web intelligence). Fredrik is living by the motto that it should be fun - and what he does not know is compensated by enthusiasm for the subject.

                    <h2>From Edge to Extreme Edge: Exploring the Dimensions of AI Inference in IoT | Roberto Morabito</h2>
                    <p>Apr 04, 2024 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                    <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                        This talk presents an in-depth exploration of the dual facets of AI inference within the IoT ecosystem: the established edge computing and the emerging "extreme edge", where TinyML is gaining prominence. We delve into how these two spheres interact and complement each other, driving advancements in AI-driven IoT applications. The discussion highlights how the proliferation of AI inference accelerators and varying software, hardware, and networking configurations are shaping the landscape of computational efficiency and real-time responsiveness. We will explore the development of frameworks that accommodate hardware diversity, ensuring optimized AI inference performance across a spectrum of devices. The seminar will also shed light on the strategies for seamless integration and coordination of devices at both the edge and the extreme edge. Emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making, we will discuss how these technologies enable robust AI capabilities in diverse applications. As a future perspective, we will briefly consider the potential role of emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, in further enhancing the capabilities and applications of AI inference within IoT.
