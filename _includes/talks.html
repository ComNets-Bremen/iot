                        <h2>Dirk Pesch | Low Power Wide-Area Wireless Internet of Things with LoRaWAN</h2>
                        <p>Jan 05, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>
                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> Connectivity, particularly wireless connectivity, is a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things. A plethora of technologies exist, ranging from short-range to long-range and low to medium power options. Recently, long-range, low-power wireless communication technologies have been introduced for both licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum technologies such as LoRa/LoRaWAN have become very popular because of their low cost, open standard and open-source software support. However, the current standard has many weaknesses in supporting a vision of dense, wireless IoT device deployment. In this talk, we will briefly review long-range, low-power wireless technologies, review some of the weaknesses of LoRaWAN and present a range of advances that address these weaknesses; in particular, we will focus on medium access fairness, power efficiency and delay performance for both terrestrial and satellite-based smart city and industrial IoT applications.

                        <h2>Pietro Manzoni | AIoT for environmental Intelligence</h2>
                        <p>Feb 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
                        Environmental Intelligence refers to using digital technologies to gain insight into our impact on the environment and develop strategies to mitigate or reverse the effects of climate change. The talk will provide insights related to the applications of AIoT for environmental intelligence, focusing on data collection. It will show the approach and some of the results from research activities related to monitoring a natural lagoon in the southern part of Spain, namely the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, Spain). This ecosystem supports many human activities encompassing tourism, agriculture, fishing, and mining, leading to its deterioration. The project’s overall objective was to develop cross-cutting and green technology for modeling and predicting socio-environmental processes across different temporal and spatial scales. We wanted to achieve this through a digital twin strategy that allows researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers to collect data cost-effectively and create more precise models and predictions to support better decision-making.</p>

                        <h2>Carlo Boano | The IoT and the two sides of Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>Mar 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
                        IoT systems are often portrayed as a key driver for sustainability and as an essential technology to achieve many of the seventeen United Nations’ sustainable development goals by 2030. Among others, IoT systems can help improving health and well-being, building smart cities, promoting a responsible production and consumption, increasing awareness and visibility into energy and resource usage, as well as facilitating access to clean energy. At the same time, sustainability is often not a concern during the design of an IoT system: several IoT gadgets are unnecessary, many IoT products become quickly obsolete, and poorly-performing IoT devices are quickly dismissed. As a result, IoT hardware often ends up as e-waste into landfill after a very short lifespan, which is worrying considering the magnitude of IoT devices expected in the next decade. In this talk, I will illustrate this paradox with concrete examples and highlight the need to maximize the usability and lifetime of IoT systems, presenting technical solutions that could help in this regard.</p>

                        <h2>Marco Zúñiga | Sunlight for wireless communication</h2>
                        <p>Apr 06, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            We, humans, already use 50% more energy moving information than moving airplanes around the world. Communication is central to our societies but is taking a toll on the earth.

                            We want to use a free, abundant, and natural resource for wireless communication: sunlight. Similar to the way you can use a mirror to communicate by reflecting light, our aim is to change the surfaces of objects to control their reflection properties to send information, but without noticing any flicker!
                            
                            In this manner, objects will be able to talk to each other using daylight, an eco-friendly solution. In this talk, we will present some of our recent work on this exciting area and its potential applications.
                            
                            A world that communicates through natural light. That’s the goal.

                        <h2>Barbora Buhnova | Trust Management in Social Internet of Things</h2>
                        <p>May 04, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            Digitalization is leading us towards a future where people, processes, data and things are not only interacting with each other, but might start forming societies on their own. In these dynamic systems, converging towards Social Internet of Things (SIoT), trust management on the level of human-to-thing as well as thing-to-thing interaction becomes an essential ingredient to supervise safe and secure progress of our digitalized future. In this talk, we will look into the essential elements of trust management in complex digital ecosystems and SIoT, including trust assessment and its influencing factors (e.g., feeling vulnerable), trust propagation (e.g., via reputation), and trust updates (e.g., via dynamic certification schemes). We will give an overview of the current open discussions about the trust management strategies and discuss their risks and related trust attacks (e.g, self-promotion or whitewashing).
