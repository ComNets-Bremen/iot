                        <p>Dec 01, 2022 | 4:00 PM CET</p>
                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
                        This seminar will engage in the lessons learned from designing, developing and deploying the LoRa-DTN IoT platform. This platform was tailor-made by and for the Sami reindeer herding population in the north of Sweden. Due to the harsh Arctic winter conditions, lack of power and internet infrastructure, remoteness and inaccessible terrains, conventional off-the-shelf IoT solutions were not applicable. Hence, the LoRa-DTN platform was developed in order to provide reindeer herders ability to track their reindeer herds, exchange short messages, use drones as a data relay and monitor the ice thickness on lakes during winter time. The platform is built on a custom hardware and employs LoRa radios and custom-built network protocol based on the Delay Tolerant Network architecture (using Store-And-Forward principle).</p>
                        <p><strong>About Speaker:</strong>
                        Since 2016, Samo Grasic has worked at Dálvvadis economical association, Jokkmokk, where he designs and develops the Nomatrack LoRa-DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) platform. This platform is tailor-made for reindeer herding purposes in remote Arctic environments. Samo is the member of the The Inter Planetary Networking Special Interest Group and the co-author of the PRoPHET routing protocol (RFC 6693). Samo received his PhD from Luleå University of Technology, in the subject of of Human Work Science, in 2014. Here, focus ison development and deployment of the ICT infrastructure DTN for sparsely populated Arctic regions. Samo’s interests include routing in computer networks, energy harvesting, low power systems, soft, and hardware development as well as embedded systems. Samo is also interested in the social, and economical aspects of ICT deployments. Prior to his academic career, Samo worked for more than six years in the industry, developing hardware and software components for meteorological and radiological systems.</p>

                        <h2>Dirk Pesch | Low Power Wide-Area Wireless Internet of Things with LoRaWAN</h2>
                        <p>Jan 05, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>
                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> Connectivity, in particular wireless connectivity, is a key enabling technology for the Internet
                            of Things. A plethora of technologies exist ranging from short range to long range and low to
                            medium power options. Recently, long range, low power wireless communication
                            technologies have been introduced, for both licensed and unlicensed radio spectrum.
                            Unlicensed spectrum technologies such as LoRa/LoRaWAN have become very popular
                            because of their low cost, open standard and open-source software support. However, the
                            current standard has many weaknesses in supporting a vision of dense, wireless IoT device
                            deployment. In this talk we will briefly review long range, low power wireless technologies,
                            review some of the weaknesses of LoRaWAN and present a range of advances that
                            address these weaknesses, in particular we will focus on medium access fairness, power
                            efficiency and delay performance for both terrestrial and satellite based smart city and
                            industrial IoT applications.

                        <p>Feb 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
                        Environmental Intelligence refers to using digital technologies to gain insight into our impact on the environment and develop strategies to mitigate or reverse the effects of climate change. The talk will provide insights related to the applications of AIoT for environmental intelligence, focusing on data collection. It will show the approach and some of the results from research activities related to monitoring a natural lagoon in the southern part of Spain, namely the Mar Menor lagoon (Murcia, Spain). This ecosystem supports many human activities encompassing tourism, agriculture, fishing, and mining, leading to its deterioration. The project’s overall objective was to develop cross-cutting and green technology for modeling and predicting socio-environmental processes across different temporal and spatial scales. We wanted to achieve this through a digital twin strategy that allows researchers, stakeholders, and policy-makers to collect data cost-effectively and create more precise models and predictions to support better decision-making.</p>

                        <h2>Carlo Boano | The IoT and the two sides of Sustainability</h2>
                        <p>Mar 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
                        IoT systems are often portrayed as a key driver for sustainability and as an essential technology to achieve many of the seventeen United Nations’ sustainable development goals by 2030. Among others, IoT systems can help improving health and well-being, building smart cities, promoting a responsible production and consumption, increasing awareness and visibility into energy and resource usage, as well as facilitating access to clean energy. At the same time, sustainability is often not a concern during the design of an IoT system: several IoT gadgets are unnecessary, many IoT products become quickly obsolete, and poorly-performing IoT devices are quickly dismissed. As a result, IoT hardware often ends up as e-waste into landfill after a very short lifespan, which is worrying considering the magnitude of IoT devices expected in the next decade. In this talk, I will illustrate this paradox with concrete examples and highlight the need to maximize the usability and lifetime of IoT systems, presenting technical solutions that could help in this regard.</p>

                        <p><strong>About Speaker:</strong>
                        Carlo Alberto Boano is an associate professor at the Institute of Technical Informatics of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), Austria. He received the Venia Docendi in “Embedded Systems” from TU Graz with an Habilitation thesis entitled “Technologies and Tools for the Design of Dependable Networked Embedded Systems” in 2020. He also received from TU Graz a doctoral degree under the auspices of the President of the Austrian Republic in 2016 with a thesis entitled “Dependable Wireless Sensor Networks” and completed under the supervision of Kay Römer.
                        Before joining TU Graz, Carlo Alberto Boano was researcher at the University of Lübeck, Germany (2009-2013) and at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden (2008-2009). During his post-doctoral time at TU Graz, he has visited Thiemo Voigt’s group at Uppsala University, Mun Choon Chan’s group at the National University of Singapore, and Yuan He’s group at Tsinghua University.
                        Carlo Alberto’s research interests encompass the design of dependable networked embedded systems, with emphasis on the efficiency and reliability of low-power wireless communications, as well as on the robustness of IoT networking protocols against environmental influences. Within this area, he has published over 100 peer-reviewed contributions – including papers at prestigious venues ranked CORE A/A*, such as SenSys, IPSN, NDSS, INFOCOM, RTSS, ICNP, ICDCS – and received several awards.</p>
