                        <h2>The IoT and the two sides of Sustainability | Carlo Boano</h2>
                        <p>Mar 02, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong>
                        IoT systems are often portrayed as a key driver for sustainability and as an essential technology to achieve many of the seventeen United Nations’ sustainable development goals by 2030. Among others, IoT systems can help improving health and well-being, building smart cities, promoting a responsible production and consumption, increasing awareness and visibility into energy and resource usage, as well as facilitating access to clean energy. At the same time, sustainability is often not a concern during the design of an IoT system: several IoT gadgets are unnecessary, many IoT products become quickly obsolete, and poorly-performing IoT devices are quickly dismissed. As a result, IoT hardware often ends up as e-waste into landfill after a very short lifespan, which is worrying considering the magnitude of IoT devices expected in the next decade. In this talk, I will illustrate this paradox with concrete examples and highlight the need to maximize the usability and lifetime of IoT systems, presenting technical solutions that could help in this regard.</p>

                        <p><strong>About Speaker:</strong>
                        Carlo Alberto Boano is an associate professor at the Institute of Technical Informatics of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), Austria. He received the Venia Docendi in “Embedded Systems” from TU Graz with an Habilitation thesis entitled “Technologies and Tools for the Design of Dependable Networked Embedded Systems” in 2020. He also received from TU Graz a doctoral degree under the auspices of the President of the Austrian Republic in 2016 with a thesis entitled “Dependable Wireless Sensor Networks” and completed under the supervision of Kay Römer.
                        Before joining TU Graz, Carlo Alberto Boano was researcher at the University of Lübeck, Germany (2009-2013) and at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, Sweden (2008-2009). During his post-doctoral time at TU Graz, he has visited Thiemo Voigt’s group at Uppsala University, Mun Choon Chan’s group at the National University of Singapore, and Yuan He’s group at Tsinghua University.
                        Carlo Alberto’s research interests encompass the design of dependable networked embedded systems, with emphasis on the efficiency and reliability of low-power wireless communications, as well as on the robustness of IoT networking protocols against environmental influences. Within this area, he has published over 100 peer-reviewed contributions – including papers at prestigious venues ranked CORE A/A*, such as SenSys, IPSN, NDSS, INFOCOM, RTSS, ICNP, ICDCS – and received several awards.</p>

                        <h2>Sunlight for wireless communication | Marco Zúñiga</h2>
                        <p>Apr 06, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            We, humans, already use 50% more energy moving information than moving airplanes around the world. Communication is central to our societies but is taking a toll on the earth.

                            We want to use a free, abundant, and natural resource for wireless communication: sunlight. Similar to the way you can use a mirror to communicate by reflecting light, our aim is to change the surfaces of objects to control their reflection properties to send information, but without noticing any flicker!
                            
                            In this manner, objects will be able to talk to each other using daylight, an eco-friendly solution. In this talk, we will present some of our recent work on this exciting area and its potential applications.
                            
                            A world that communicates through natural light. That’s the goal.

                            Dr. Marco Zúñiga is an Associate Professor in the Networked Systems Group at TU Delft. His research interests are in the areas of the Internet of Things, Mobile Computing, and Visible Light Communication. He obtained his Ph.D. and MSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, and his BSc in Electronics Engineering from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú.

                            Dr. Zúñiga has more than 60 scientific publications and has received three Best Paper Awards, five Best Paper Runner-ups, and an Accenture Innovation Award in 2017. Two of his publications are the 3rd and 16th most cited papers in the ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks. Dr. Zúñiga has also been invited to present his work on "Sunlight for wireless communication" at the Innovation Expo 2018, a flagship event organized by six Dutch Ministries to showcase Dutch innovation to the world.

                        <h2>Trust Management in Social Internet of Things | Barbora Buhnova</h2>
                        <p>May 04, 2023 | 4:00 PM CET</p>

                        <p><strong>About Topic:</strong> 
                            Digitalization is leading us towards a future where people, processes, data and things are not only interacting with each other, but might start forming societies on their own. In these dynamic systems, converging towards Social Internet of Things (SIoT), trust management on the level of human-to-thing as well as thing-to-thing interaction becomes an essential ingredient to supervise safe and secure progress of our digitalized future. In this talk, we will look into the essential elements of trust management in complex digital ecosystems and SIoT, including trust assessment and its influencing factors (e.g., feeling vulnerable), trust propagation (e.g., via reputation), and trust updates (e.g., via dynamic certification schemes). We will give an overview of the current open discussions about the trust management strategies and discuss their risks and related trust attacks (e.g, self-promotion or whitewashing).
